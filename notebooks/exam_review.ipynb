    "The \"Python Basics\" questions cover content from the summer pre-course -- which we include here as a reminder that these concepts are fair game for the exam.\n",

    "Your exam will be done on pen and paper. Some of these questions ask you to write code. This is intentional. Your exam will contain programming questions. Most of these will be either \"fill in the blank\"  or \"multiple choice\". You should use the programming practice in this notebook to review programming concepts so you are prepared to write out similar code by hand during the exam."
